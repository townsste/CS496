		<h1>Townsend REST Implementation NOTES</h1>
		<div>
			<center><h2>Here are the notes that will help with the demonstration of the REST API.</h2></center>
			<div>
				<h3>App is hosted at:</h3>
					<p>https://cs496-rest-townsend.appspot.com</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h3>Making API Calls</h3>
				<p>To make api calls you will need the hosted url in each call as the {base url}<br>
				Example: GET https://cs496-rest-townsend.appspot.com<br><br>
				Anything in {} or double {}, will need to be filled in as indicated below.<br>
				After a boat or slip is created then they will have a unique ID attached.<br><br>
				You can get this ID by a GET boats or slips call.<br>
				Example: GET https://cs496-rest-townsend.appspot.com/boats<br><br>
				This call will return a json with specific information.<br>
				Parse through the json to get the ID.<br>
				This ID will be required to make modifications.</p>
